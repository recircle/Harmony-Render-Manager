# OSX Harmony Render Manager
Easy render manager for ToonBoom Harmony. It basically modifies the original xstage document and artificial video export settings. The plan includes the ability to select the type of export (video or image sequence) and individual elements. Unfortunately only the OSX version but if anyone wants to help and make a WIN / universal version I would be more than grateful.
