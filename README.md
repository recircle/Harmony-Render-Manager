# Harmony-Render-Manager
Simple render manager for ToonBoom Harmony. It basically modifies the xstage (xml) document, insert video export settings and duplicates original document. The plan is to includes the ability to select the type of export (video or image sequence) and individual elements/characters. 

Unfortunately only the OSX version but if anyone wants to help and make a WIN / universal version I would be more than grateful.
